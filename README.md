Bioinformatics Core Facility Rates
==================================

This is a record and visualisation of publicly posted rates for bioinformatics core facilities.

The data was collected from publicly available web resources on 3rd April 2024.

Rates were converted into UK pounds using the rates on the day the data was collected

* US Dollars at 0.8
* Canadian Dollars at 0.69
* Danish Krone at 0.11
* Sweedish Krona at 0.074
* Euro at 0.86

Caveats
-------
In each case I have simply taken the lowest and highest advertised hourly rates for bioinformatics work. These values may not be directly comparable for a number of reasons.

1. Some of these facilities will be subsidised so this may not reflect the full economic cost of the service
2. Different rates of tax may need to be added to the quoted prices
3. Differing calculations may go into the assignment of time (does compute time count for example)
4. Some of the posted values may not actually be correct at the current date (I ignored some sites with rates dated well before the current date)
